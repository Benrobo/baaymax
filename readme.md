# BaayMax üòé

> Hey everyone, I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to archive the BaayMax repository. As many of you know, BaayMax is a tool for developers to generate intuitive, unique, and flexible portfolio sites. While it has been a useful tool for many of you, my schedule has become too busy to properly maintain it. However, I am not abandoning the project completely! I have plans to build a much more stable release and version of BaayMax that will not only be accessible for developers, but also for designers and non-developers. My goal is to create a product that is useful for a wider range of users and can be easily accessed and used by anyone. Thank you for your understanding and support as I work towards creating a better product. Stay tuned for updates on the new release of BaayMax!

BaayMax uses EmailJs a javascript library for sending mails right into your inbox. So do the following.

1. Visit https://emailjs.com.
2. Create an account.
3. Follow the instructions on setting up yours @ https://www.emailjs.com/docs/sdk/installation/. If you feel lost checkout my old [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdXo9rravmk&t=1762s) where I explain how to send mails using this library. [ Disclaimer: the video was made when I was still a beginner, so take whatever you see as a beginner. ].
Replace the below config with yours, if not, users wont be able to send MESSAGE to your inbox.

### Step 6

Dont forget to setup your `Emailjs Template` as shown in the picture, if you feel like adding a different style, also update the `template` object found in `/components/contact/index.js <line 86:90>`

<img src="https://github.com/Benrobo/baaymax-assets/blob/main/emailjs.PNG?raw=true">

```javascript
    86 const templateParams = {
    87    from_name: name,
    88    sender_email: email,
    89    message: message
    90 };
```

### Step 7

Upload your `CV / RESUME` file within the `public/CV` folder with the name `resume.pdf` just as seen in the picture below.

# Customizing your site theme.
This can be done by simply updating some of the `color codes` found in `tailwind.config.js`

> ALSO, IF YOU FEEL NOTHING CHANGE AFTER MAKING NECESSARY UPDATES, SIMPLY CLEAR `CACHE STORAGE` ALONG WITH `LOCALSTORAGE`.
